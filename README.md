# Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis & Predictive Modelling

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the Zomato dataset to uncover key insights about the factors influencing the establishment and success of various types of restaurants in **Bengaluru**, India. Bengaluru is home to over 12,000 restaurants, catering to the city's diverse population. The goal of this analysis is to understand which factors (e.g., location, cuisine type, cost, and customer ratings) drive restaurant success and how new restaurants can better compete in an increasingly crowded market.

With Bengaluru being a major IT hub, most residents rely heavily on restaurant food, creating a high demand for diverse dining options. This project explores these trends to provide actionable insights for restaurant owners, investors, and food entrepreneurs looking to enter the market.

## Objective

- **Primary Goal**: Identify the key factors that influence restaurant ratings, popularity, and success in different areas of Bengaluru.
- **Secondary Goal**: Use machine learning models to predict restaurant ratings and recommend strategies for new restaurant establishments based on demographic and locality-specific preferences (e.g., vegetarian or non-vegetarian preferences driven by local populations such as Jain, Marwari, or Gujarati communities).

## Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Analyze trends related to restaurant types, locations, cuisines, and price ranges.
  - Understand how aggregate ratings vary by restaurant type, locality, and customer preferences.
- **Predictive Modelling**:
  - Build machine learning models to predict restaurant ratings based on features such as cost, location, cuisine, and other factors.
  - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, root mean square error (RMSE), and feature importance.

## Data Insights

The analysis seeks to answer the following questions:
- Which localities in Bengaluru are most favorable for opening new restaurants?
- What types of cuisines are most popular in different neighborhoods?
- How do factors like restaurant type, cost for two, and location influence the aggregate rating of a restaurant?
- Are there areas that prefer vegetarian or non-vegetarian food based on the demographic composition?

## Data

The dataset contains the following key features:
- **Restaurant Name**: Name of the restaurant.
- **Location**: Neighborhood or locality in Bengaluru.
- **Cuisines**: The type of cuisine(s) the restaurant offers.
- **Average Cost for Two**: The average cost of dining for two people.
- **Aggregate Rating**: The overall rating given by Zomato users.
- **Votes**: The number of votes a restaurant has received.
- **Type of Restaurant**: Whether it’s a casual dining, café, bar, etc.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: For data analysis, visualization, and model building.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For organizing the workflow.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizing trends and relationships in the data.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.

## Project Structure

- `Zomato_EDA&Modelling_OlaElShiekh_Dsquares.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the steps for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and model building.
  
## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Zomato_EDA_Modelling.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Zomato_EDA&Modelling_OlaElShiekh_Dsquares.ipynb
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: 
   - Load the Zomato dataset into the notebook.
   - Clean the data by handling missing values and creating relevant features for analysis.

2. **EDA & Visualization**:
   - Explore the data using various visualizations such as bar charts, heatmaps, and scatter plots to identify trends in restaurant types, locations, and aggregate ratings.
   
3. **Model Building**:
   - Implement predictive models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Trees to predict restaurant ratings.
   - Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics like RMSE and R².

4. **Insights & Recommendations**:
   - Based on the analysis, generate insights on ideal locations for opening new restaurants and strategies for targeting the right audience.

## Results and Insights

The analysis provides insights into:
- **Restaurant Location**: Key localities where specific restaurant types (e.g., vegetarian, non-vegetarian) thrive.
- **Cuisine Preferences**: Popular cuisines across different neighborhoods and demographic influences.
- **Cost vs. Rating**: Relationship between the average cost for two people and the restaurant’s rating.
- **Restaurant Competition**: Analysis of new vs. established restaurants and strategies for new entrants to compete effectively.
